# âš¡ My Snippets
I created my own Emmet snippets in VSCode.
I need some of these specific abbreviations on a regular basis, so I saved them as a snippet to further improve my workflow.

## ðŸš€ How to start: 
* Create a file called "snippets.json" and add the following basic code to it:

```
{
  "html": {
    "snippets": { }
  },
  "css": {
    "snippets": { }
  }
}
```
* Open the settings of VSCode and look for the option "Emmet Extensions Path". We add the path of the folder where the "snippets.json" file is located. Attention! The folder path, not the file path itself. I have created it in a route where I synchronize with my cloud so as not to lose it in the future.

* Add your own abbreviations. I have been guided by the following pages, but I loved the first one, with very common examples and a breakdown of how it works:
  * [Creating Custom Emmet Snippets In VS Code](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/06/custom-emmet-snippets-vscode/#lazy-loading)
  * [How to expand Emmet abbreviations and snippets](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/emmet)
  * [Personalizar Emmet en Visual Studio Code](https://www.jasoft.org/Blog/post/personalizar-emmet-en-visual-studio-code-y-librarse-del-meta-x-ua-compatible-ie-edge)

* You may need to reset your VSCode but it would be done! I created an HTML and CSS file to test that they work correctly and maybe I can come up with some other ideas.
